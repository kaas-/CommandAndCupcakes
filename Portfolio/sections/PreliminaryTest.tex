\section{Games used}
We investigated already existing games on AirConsole to see how many times people looked between the main screen and the phone. In the test we used the two games:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mockingbird
\item Tic Tac Boom
\end{itemize}

Mockingbird is a game in which the player controls a bird. You do so by tapping the screen in order to make the bird fly upwards. By tilting the phone, the bird’s flight changes from directly flying upwards and falling to sideways parabola paths. The controls are shown on the main screen during startup of the game, and they persist on the screen of the phone throughout gameplay, as shown in the figures below. The objective is to collect eggs while avoiding other birds.
