\chapter{Premiminary test}\label{ch:PreTest}
\section{Test setup}
Players were seated in such a way that they would be facing a PC screen placed on a table. A camera above and behind the PC screen recorded the players. Each test participant was given a smartphone to use with the AirConsole platform. Test participants played a designated game uninterrupted to emulate a casual playing environment. Screen recording software was installed on the participant’s smartphone as well as the PC screen. Eye tracking was also used to track the eye focus of the participant, whose smartphone was also recorded.

\section{Games used}
We investigated already existing games on AirConsole to see how many times people looked between the main screen and the phone. In the test we used the two games:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mockingbird
\item Tic Tac Boom
\end{itemize}

Mockingbird is a game in which the player controls a bird by tapping the screen in order to make the bird fly upwards. By tilting the phone, the bird’s flight changes from directly flying upwards and falling to sideways parabola paths. The controls are shown on the main screen during startup of the game, and they persist on the screen of the phone throughout gameplay, as shown in the Figures below. The objective of the game is to collect eggs while avoiding other birds.

Tic Tac Boom is a game where a player controls a character in an obstacle-filled arena. The character is controlled with buttons on the smartphone. There are controls for four-directional movement, placement of bombs, and three individually activatable powerups. The powerups light up when they are available and are greyed out when unavailable. The controls layout is seen in the Figures below, with the topmost powerup being unavailable and bottommost being available respectively. The objective of the game is to blow up the opponent with bombs, while avoiding getting blown up by the opponent and yourself. The arena can be destroyed by bombs, which is required in order to get to the opponent.

The table shows how many times the player looked off the screen and else where.

\end{figure}

When comparing the numbers in the two tables, it could be seen that participants looked at their phones considerably less when playing Mockingbird, than Tic Tac Boom. This indicated that simpler controls would lead players to focus on the main screen of the game. Inversely, by having more controls to manipulate, including powerups and special abilities, the players looked more down on their screens to verify that the correct area of the controller was pressed.
