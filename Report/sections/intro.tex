\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}
In this modern day, it is a common sight to see almost everyone with a smartphone, either in use or at least near their person at almost all times. AirConsole has taken advantage of this by creating a video game platform that enables players to use a computer as a shared screen and their smartphones as controllers. This allows for game developers to design controllers with many different designs, since the controller consists entirely of a webpage running on the smartphone.

This setup raises some interesting questions. The players have to divide their attention between two screens: their own smartphone, and the computer monitor shared between all players in the room. How can designers ensure that players' attention is directed properly? What stimuli are more effective to direct attention between the two screens?

These questions are what this project seeks to answer. It does so by first investigating theory on what attention is and how to manipulate and measure it. Based on this theory, an experiment is conducted in an attempt to evaluate methods that direct attention between the two screens. The experiment includes multiple versions of the same game where different attention directing methods are included in each one.
